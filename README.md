# Pure-css-gallery

This is a responsive image gallery all in pure css. 
Yes, it has all those j-query-like cool fading transitions and stuff.

Pure css is the future!

I will soon adapt this gallery to my personal website. The gallery will be put inside Jekyll's static website structure and become modular thanks to Liquid.

This is just the prototype, I will soon provide a tidier version with clearer comments.
